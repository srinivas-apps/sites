                <p>
                    Welcome! Your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how our Duplicate Contact Merge application ("App") handles your information. The most important thing to know is that we believe your contacts are your private data, and we've designed the App to respect that.
                </p>

                        The App performs all its functions—including scanning for duplicates, merging contacts, creating backups, and restoring from backups—entirely on your iPhone or iPad. Your contacts and personal information are never sent to, stored on, or processed by any external servers.
                    </p>

                <!-- Section: Information Collection -->
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4">1. Information We Access (With Your Permission)</h2>
                <p>
                    To perform its functions, our App requires permission to access your contacts. This is the only personal information we interact with. We do not collect, read, or store any other information from your device.
                </p>

                <!-- Section: How Information is Used -->
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4">2. How Your Contact Information Is Used</h2>
                <p>
                    Your contact list is used exclusively for the following features within the App:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Merge Duplicates:</strong> The App reads your contacts locally to identify potential duplicates and allows you to merge them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Backup Contacts:</strong> The App creates a backup file of your contacts. This backup file is stored securely in the App's private local storage on your device, which only you and the App can access.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Restore Contacts:</strong> The App uses a local backup file you select to restore your contacts.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To be perfectly clear: we do not upload, share, analyze, or even view your contact list. The entire process is automated and confined to your device.
                </p>

                <!-- Section: Data Storage -->
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4">3. Data Storage</h2>
                <p>
                    All data, including any contact backups created by the App, is stored locally on your device. You have full control over this data. If you delete the App, all associated data, including backups, will be removed from your device.
                </p>
                
                <!-- Section: Third Parties -->
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4">4. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
                <p>
                    Since we do not collect your information, we certainly do not share it. The App does not contain any third-party analytics, advertising services, or SDKs that would have access to your contacts.
                </p>

                <!-- Section: Children's Privacy -->
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4">5. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. The App's functions are not directed at children.
                </p>

                <!-- Section: Policy Changes -->
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4">6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
