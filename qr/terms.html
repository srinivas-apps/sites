      <p>Welcome to SubTrack (“we”, “our”, “us”). These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the SubTrack iOS application (“App”) and related services. By downloading, installing, or using SubTrack, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the App.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">1. Eligibility & Account</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction) to use SubTrack. By using the App, you represent that you meet this requirement. SubTrack does not require account registration; however, if you use iCloud Sync or purchase a subscription, your Apple ID is used for authentication and billing through Apple’s App Store.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">2. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
      <p>SubTrack offers both free and premium features. Premium access is available through the following in-app purchases managed by <strong>RevenueCat</strong> and billed via your <strong>Apple ID</strong>:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Yearly Subscription:</strong> Automatically renews every year unless cancelled.</li>
        <li><strong>Lifetime Purchase:</strong> One-time payment granting permanent access to premium features.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All payments and subscriptions are processed by Apple and subject to Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">App Store Terms of Service</a>. We do not have access to your payment information.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">3. Renewal & Cancellation</h2>
      <p>Your Yearly Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel subscriptions at any time through your Apple ID settings on your device. If you cancel, you’ll retain premium access until the end of the current billing period. Lifetime purchases are non-recurring and non-expiring.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">4. Refunds</h2>
      <p>Refunds for subscriptions or in-app purchases are handled directly by Apple. We do not issue refunds or credits ourselves. To request a refund, please visit Apple’s official refund portal: <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">5. License & Usage Rights</h2>
